once with,11
that works,12
the teriyaki,92
or a,114
first time,590
or i,29
of good,96
usually pretty,26
all and,64
is ridiculously,11
it's time,10
have always,120
specials which,13
you're on,16
for fast,37
wine and,25
is fresh,102
what you'd,27
you off,33
and singapore,21
stuff to,18
take out,1629
lot is,16
lot in,10
even like,18
another place,42
other dishes,177
the bones,21
reviews i,32
we try,15
famous for,10
giving this,45
tasted old,20
it's clean,24
contrary to,10

with both,22
settled on,18
little dry,22
over to,130

scallions and,22
in small,11
and slightly,19
start off,40
pepper pork,146
starting to,21
but otherwise,24
they use,140
we discovered,15
pricey but,33
and looking,26
house is,35
at each,22
ordered orange,31
of crab,58
chinese eatery,16
do have,105
first of,73
while waiting,36
and broth,17
pan and,15
which just,13
tons are,11
times we,24
large groups,21
the bbq,176
rude to,18
pao beef,37
with egg,112
though a,18
is actually,102

you'd think,12
star but,11
options on,21
they charged,35
here this,21
meal to,29
dozens of,11
actually get,10
your money,108
they weren't,80

the lady that,21
hate it when,10
they did have,15
in a hurry,47
and the kung,36
i cannot wait,12
mongolian beef and,138
expensive for the,10
best way to,20

pieces of shrimp,14
when i see,12
the meat was,98
of the food,370
time i visit,16
of the entrees,21
but the portion,14
was so fresh,11
and while the,15
ordered a few,26
i thought the,92
on the door,12
less than for,10
on a recommendation,10
not want to,42
place in the,77
portion sizes are,31
the texture was,16
in to get,14
menu is huge,22
it took about,18
here again and,23
could have gone,12
never order from,34
the poor quality,10
price for the,26
off with a,13
in a big,19
is definitely not,21
write home about,79
and didn't taste,11
worth the wait,38
the fried wontons,25
portions are generous,28
lobster fried rice,10
staff was super,10
have to pay,30
in about minutes,37
food to be,52
probably the worst,16
both dishes were,32
from now on,31
minutes before they,12
of the line,13
in the order,17
me if i,18
in my dish,13
ordered kung pao,26
can't believe how,10
beef hot pot,17
i wish the,15
in our area,14
the counter is,13
and when the,11
the sauces were,19
so excited to,17
they came out,15
but at least,54
pork and chicken,19
it stars but,10
at the place,11
chinese take out,249
portions were generous,12
and lo mein,43
that's what i,24
my friend and,57
did have a,27
the fried dumplings,26
any other place,22
it can be,40
can't remember what,10
the whole place,18
seem to be,61
and pork and,10
and i had,151
good food at,23
panda express and,52
usually get the,45
the outside was,13
with the chinese,12
you find at,10
lan zhou beef,22
food for delivery,13
in the front,40
go to place,80
and if i,27
staff were very,11
we really enjoyed,21
really enjoyed this,12
you need a,15
over cooked and,21
so i won't,13
it was her,10
a good size,30
but once you,10
a table and,16
nothing to rave,13
try it out,63
we want to,13
far from the,13
asked the waiter,15
stay at the,12
what i really,12
don't get it,16
walked into the,11
the whole experience,18
favorite chinese restaurant,90
wonton soup was,57
the quality was,20
in the kitchen,71
to a lot,13
if you were,20
of kung pao,16
way over priced,10
an array of,14
with sweet and,28
would give them,12
place and the,18
they are more,11
came in a,43
a bite to,10
was enough to,16
ping pang pong,10
every dish we,10
i was going,48

the chinese restaurants,39
place to grab,16
what i was,62
fresh and they,11
will never return,25
the shrimp are,12
and the sushi,12
seemed like a,24
of flavor and,31
the iced tea,15
the best place,42
best part is,21
and the hot,20
is second to,10
all the bad,12
the traditional chinese,14
or take out,35
go out to,14
from all the,19
the real thing,11
seems like a,19
and the portion,39

for two people,44
our food to,18

restaurant that has,17
hubby and i,29
when we were,55
taking my order,19
the dumplings and,23
if you have,153

our drinks and,14
make sure they,10
that i've ever,17
than most places,23
was all very,16
to have to,34
the chicken wings,42
in a to,11
enjoyed our meal,13
near my house,17
it is good,46
place to check,10
might be a,41
as the best,10
feel like you're,11
the best one,11
you would expect,53
with a party,10
interior of the,11
the salt and,131
everything about this,10
it to you,14
here is really,10
is probably the,45
and i haven't,11
that i found,13
here again if,10
i will admit,12
our table was,12
taking our order,16
the baked pork,16
service is fast,58
and i'm not,32
had a bad,112
and i did,19
at home and,12
found a chinese,11
to cover the,10
worth the trip,24
like it and,12
beans with xo,10
my boyfriend ordered,12
to go as,10
is comparable to,11
the delivery man,15
small and the,10
spicy for me,15
and you don't,19
and did i,11
it was spicy,22
they always get,10
supposed to be,117
you can make,10
the portion size,58
of the waiters,10
very fast and,26
was a nice,64
complaint is that,32
the interior decor,10
thing that was,16
must be doing,10
is the one,12
there with my,12
had in the,53
food poisoning from,15
their menu and,31
egg flower soup,89
we asked for,56
my husband ordered,39
as spicy as,27
pot of hot,10
for a reason,10
seemed like the,13
is nothing to,16
the whole meal,20
i get there,22
it's a small,31
i mean really,11
we went here,35
very tender and,20
chow fun for,12
on a budget,31
i didn't think,30
the prices aren't,11
of a meal,10

not to be,28
i've had better,68
know that i,15
nice but the,12

and service is,39
far from my,12
for the entire,11
which i love,26
for delivery and,31
of authentic chinese,13
to have some,29
level of service,14
to bring us,16
a cup of,71

new york style,76
to be delivered,16

for half the,19
vegetables in the,17
get a good,30
a fast food,53
was tasty but,19
the generals chicken,18
not good enough,15
great price for,11
ended up being,38
to the quality,10
a place you,11
service was nice,15
about chinese food,16
deep fried and,14
nothing more than,11
get up and,12
feel like cooking,19

when i am,48
in the area,452
the table and,49
really friendly and,22
in my book,61
the name is,11
a little overpriced,13
cooked perfectly and,13
at least two,18
for a party,19
wrong with that,10
don't need to,16
the noodle soup,34
was disappointed in,12
i thought they,22
had very little,16
at the table,87
people who work,19
of the family,10
the chinese broccoli,27
but the taste,18
of time to,10
the front counter,16
it's a pretty,13
and a side,28
but i always,21
the type of,47
they didn't have,45
from the moment,11
the hostess was,21
in the mall,14

decided to come,15
pan fried noodles,111
the menu that,38
they were all,47

if you can't,24
when they were,21

reason why i,23
frequent this place,10
the broth is,34
i'll be sure,10
were only two,11
cup of tea,16
since they are,12
and the crispy,22
a dish of,10
came here for,85
everything we ordered,23
but it had,21
was no exception,10
to it and,30
need of some,10
in and had,10
fried rice tasted,17
i tried was,12
in the name,16
in the parking,18
with friends and,15
the pieces of,19
time it was,16
it's definitely worth,14
crab rangoons and,12
but it will,11
glad i did,38
was just what,12
an off night,15
i wanted and,10
my year old,23
it was absolutely,20
a very clean,12
i'm sure they,13
get your order,13
have only been,15
the opportunity to,23
think they are,14
noodles with shrimp,18
your own risk,12
are the best,70
each of the,15
if it is,28
pork and duck,13
will go back,70
here are the,24
the guy was,11
just wanted to,32
about it and,20

good thing about,10
was hoping to,13
that it had,15
was off the,11
are generous and,16
it was good,208
i had not,18
anywhere else in,10
and there's a,11
was actually very,10
of brown rice,13
generous portions and,15
don't go there,15
with the wonton,11
for the meal,15
but i thought,28
we tried the,52
but on the,14
lo mein and,90
rather go to,19
the stir fried,25
with a couple,27
far the worst,15
has been delicious,10
this place is,1324
this place in,33
this place if,29

and a great,37
far one of,14
a week and,25

a spring roll,46
i ordered chicken,26
i was only,14
it was actually,38
the happy family,23
out from here,44
a craving for,45

very large portions,11
and it would,10
did not disappoint,43
the rest of,217
nice enough to,21

but i know,14
orange chicken tasted,13
orange chicken and,199

but not overly,10
style of chinese,13
as i waited,10
the good reviews,25
when i went,61
because it's not,11

at a great,43
with the noodles,16

and have been,54
in vegas for,33
chinese food we,22
cooked to order,34

taste of the,58

that they use,15
for a change,10

the cream cheese,52
their hot and,41
waste of money,31
my orange chicken,15
i expected it,13
the servers were,33

and ask for,17
if we were,32

i was so,97
food on a,10
people on the,11

bay area and,10
other side of,20
working in the,15
a smile on,10
i need a,16

we need to,18
of any other,11

i've eaten in,12
so that the,13

on the plate,36
a good job,16
so i'm not,21

i haven't found,18
to the brim,11
egg noodle soup,25

made me wonder,11
other items on,20
a book by,19
to keep the,15
a can of,11
have ordered the,16
my first impression,10
at other chinese,18
there on a,23
was still hot,14
was excited to,28
so were the,10
bring out the,18
haven't been here,11
don't want to,101
some dishes are,11
place is small,22
an authentic chinese,29
portions were very,12
so i figured,12
on a whim,26
i got my,34
to put it,12
to put in,12
you would find,25
along with some,15
you can add,12
so you have,14
they usually have,11
visit to this,12
especially considering the,11
are you kidding,14
this is good,15
the not so,17
as often as,13
so so so,14
but i could,19
of the lunch,41
first time last,19
out with the,18
be in a,20
is worth it,34
of the room,15
of the ingredients,26
a taste of,13
on us and,10
and my hubby,11
it was fresh,21
it didn't come,11
is spicy and,10
tried a lot,13
sea bass with,12
agree with the,22
the wait staff,104

their fried rice,57
can choose from,13
even with the,19
really enjoyed our,11
not one of,25
a bit too,68
at our table,41
happy hour and,19
don't think it,13
and rice and,10
they were closed,23
and i both,16
are really good,54
the people are,35
the food itself,53
but it's worth,17
to jade palace,14

so i asked,34

an order for,31
rice that was,12
are in a,27
fresh and crisp,13
you have been,14
authentic chinese dishes,12
any of it,17

one thing that,19
call ahead and,14
chinese broccoli with,22
like the chicken,12

go go is,13
a few tables,28

was given a,10
and you won't,18
that the fried,11
kong style chow,21
was pretty good,306
chicken with white,14
around the corner,54
and then they,20
brought it to,14
to share with,15
friendly service and,23
in my heart,12
a good price,56
between the two,25
to flag down,14

when i asked,55
definitely one of,26
the veggies and,13
workers and i,11
and had it,10
is this place,16
enough to take,14
on the pricey,16
a menu and,13
from out of,28

like panda express,56
i wasn't expecting,25
to try and,25
got a free,10
it does not,21
comes with it,10
is hit or,14
but it's still,10
everything i've tried,13
your typical fast,10
panda express or,28
twice now and,11
there was the,12
server was really,10
a great value,49
of vegetables and,14
with white meat,10
but they were,82
the plates were,13

and the rice,44
time we ordered,21
it was a,639
make you feel,27
last night was,11
going to do,11
we arrived at,26
flavor in the,11

my expectations were,13
too long to,10
then you can,10
a few years,71
a few hours,15
strip mall but,10
was fast and,55
noodle soup and,71
is worth the,29
the fried tofu,13
bbq pork buns,12
will be disappointed,15
i like a,10
when it comes,141
only thing that,65
not that i,12
i would not,115

fast food restaurant,11

lot of flavor,23
a cold day,12
the one that,12
back again and,18
my new favorite,44
my order in,11
my order is,12
to our table,77
to mention the,19
lunch with a,19
my favorite asian,12
food would be,23
that there were,30
which comes with,16
had in arizona,15
noodles are a,10
place is good,38
the people working,16
was looking forward,12
have no problem,15
and the chinese,14
i find that,12
i'm happy to,10
it reminds me,15
is not that,27
the sushi was,37
the back of,46
while the food,17
and pepper squid,20
my son loves,10
i also liked,17
but i can't,32
i believe this,10
i placed my,23
get the shrimp,12
to make an,12
to be fair,23
with a very,27
some crab puffs,11
prices are extremely,11
that being said,55
the restaurant that,13
but definitely not,26
to choose from,97
the usual suspects,12
you are looking,113
chicken is the,31
a pretty decent,10
quite possibly the,14
the phone and,35
to other chinese,13
and asked if,39
great lunch specials,54
i knew it,15
that i was,79
it also had,12
but i love,33
none of it,12
this place would,40
the price i,22
and was a,28
place does not,12
next time we,35
every time we,43
cheap and the,14
is served in,17
with the lunch,32
place to dine,11
fried rice at,13
soy sauce in,12
located inside the,17
in the sauce,45
took about minutes,18
come here for,71
are my favorites,19
have to go,43
sour and spicy,10
pick up food,10
started with a,16
thing that i,18
i had a,206
so i wouldn't,10
i don't go,10
neither of us,13
carry out and,10
for the two,18
the salty side,18
best authentic chinese,11
that kind of,18
of white meat,20
i've ever tasted,14
didn't want to,84
that when you,12
my husband got,16
a sucker for,17
wait for my,12
it comes out,16
as it should,12
so i decided,72
by for lunch,20
during the lunch,19
this is one,137
right around the,20
and call it,10
that was good,14
clean and well,16
you can probably,14
i use to,18
great service and,57
brown rice is,10
for this restaurant,27
service was fast,69
order and was,13
that the owner,12
and chicken with,21
white meat chicken,53
i am happy,20
that they have,79
could have done,14
with a good,34
the pork chops,14
to spring mountain,14
soup it was,13
think it's a,15
they would be,19
family style and,21
had a craving,13
my dish was,19
and decided to,144
i just can't,21
veggie lo mein,16
to sit at,23
wonton soup and,47
noodles were very,10
place is awesome,48
that it would,38
a ton of,132
this was our,37
flavor to the,19
it could have,32
gave this place,28
possibly the worst,12
in to pick,18
such a nice,11
because it is,78
sour soup is,101
of steamed rice,25
all the great,10
is huge and,15
you decide to,16
order and i,16
because there were,12
and a friend,13
that i don't,31
been a little,16
we had ordered,27
at china grill,13
you live in,25
time we come,10
we were lucky,10
for a reasonable,13
it so i,16
large pieces of,22
we were at,16
with oyster sauce,36
a huge fan,66
a late lunch,21
to want to,16
a bit to,14
in for take,11
looking for the,19
the beef fried,12
beef with fried,12
it must have,13
suppose to be,18
right next door,17
i may be,17
portion size was,26
place to have,23
twice a month,16
but we got,15
it better than,10
and the duck,13
inside of the,28
so was the,29
the decor was,41
the menu has,46
like any other,32
bit of food,11
have to eat,17
we ordered was,42
were on the,28
pork chow mein,26
picky about my,10
of the dining,17
was in the,116
away from the,107
places like this,24
was the worst,46
we did take,12
up to par,35
the green onion,16
and the first,13
and pepper shrimp,65
is really great,17
have tried many,18
lunch special was,22
little bit of,65
a bad dish,15
if i am,24
now for the,15
friend of mine,22
to take the,35
restaurant in phoenix,18
good and it,11
and willing to,10
dining room is,22
and found a,12
i were in,13
less than a,27
at the register,28
very friendly service,14
asian cafe express,39
told him i,15
from the chicken,10
like that they,21
and see if,15
really looking forward,14
the crab angels,13
start off with,16
part of this,12
and pepper pork,95
to do this,11
back and the,10
and wanted to,39
we loved the,15
here since they,15
the food would,22
ordered to go,22
with a generous,11
worst i've ever,20
which was really,23
i don't normally,10
as well and,27
better than any,31
had never had,10
some time to,14
although i have,10
i mention the,10
was told the,13
in the new,15
the first thing,49
i was the,42
and super friendly,10
that they were,70
the texture and,10
been going to,66
but i will,61
one of those,145
local chinese food,10
chinese joint in,11
the delivery driver,22
which was decent,10
i will definitely,180
it is what,20
didn't like it,30
the take out,43
the whole thing,22
a star rating,16
and they seem,10
part of a,22
as you walk,20
sure you have,10
the noodle soups,15
above and beyond,13
start by saying,12
no flavor at,17
their sweet and,29
the order in,12
recommend the orange,10
here in a,12
in the city,31
and ready to,14
was a huge,28
how the food,18
in terms of,67
there is only,17
was quite a,13
you find in,10
noodle soup is,38
good as you,10
by this restaurant,10
and you should,10
used to work,14
lunch special and,46
clean and comfortable,11
the szechuan beef,29

side of rice,30
in the restaurant,164
not greasy at,14
and beef chow,15
it's a must,10
style of food,11
was craving chinese,22
the time it,13
a star is,13
had such a,16
went back to,21
and very fresh,11
with the check,10
fried noodles and,21
main course was,17
with the salt,10
i think i,114
a smile and,15
side of the,50
by the end,20
good hot and,10
reason for the,15
the salt pepper,42
the prices for,16
in my neighborhood,34
of them were,28
the same dishes,15
you're going to,37
had too much,23
i like to,91
food is as,11
everything we had,10
what type of,11
and house special,11
i can make,12
i really do,11
minutes for our,12
experience at this,10
when we first,16
service and quality,13
if i were,43

about an hour,22

the yelp reviews,39
any of their,25

can sometimes be,11
salt pepper calamari,10
greeted by the,16
when we arrived,38

past this place,10
roll and a,25
with soy sauce,31
and it wasn't,51
the szechwan beef,15
steamed rice and,25
green onion pancakes,16
really good but,14
would be better,32
the best food,39
hot and tasty,20
and the broccoli,14
was a good,94
and i feel,21
be prepared to,32
staff is super,26
such a big,11
because they had,11
there were more,14
crab rangoon is,13

to agree with,15

portions are huge,111
my wife is,17

totally worth it,12
we don't have,19
their won ton,13
sauce that comes,13
and have to,13
i get that,11
was great for,11

never go there,15
sauce that was,25

when the food,40
and was happy,12
service and very,13
that i ordered,20
my take out,31
they told us,13

i couldn't eat,19
sure what to,17
you should go,10
boba milk tea,12
but the shrimp,10
is no longer,17
which is a,152
the fish tanks,13

good lunch specials,17
was sorely disappointed,13
to send it,12
again for the,12
more than happy,16
husband and i,223
is one of,293
there are no,33
of meat in,11
standard chinese food,12
in old town,14

so i could,37
your choice of,55
spicy beef noodle,11
with beef and,22
me to try,12
the lan zhou,20
lives up to,12
to the side,11
felt like we,11
of the two,20
we would definitely,12
long time ago,11
and food is,32
meal was the,32
sweet sour pork,45
may have to,19
here twice and,20
and are very,12
this was very,13
for us to,37
for over a,19
on the house,17
so i thought,38
sure what it,11
when it first,11
you get soup,15
take out chinese,56
and tasty chinese,11
is a gem,12
sweet and pungent,20
this is a,482
take care of,28
time and it,17
the neighborhood and,25
had sweet and,15
happened to be,17
close to our,11
here is good,11
just thinking about,20
at your own,15
i got the,286
told me they,14
right in the,28
northern chinese food,12
lots of flavor,15
ask for them,10
a big bowl,18
like to give,14
to order and,39
we have eaten,33
a favorite of,15
since i am,13
one more time,11
the orange sauce,17
had in las,10
is ok but,10
if they had,41
i thoroughly enjoyed,12
service is really,15
coming to this,22
but every time,11
adds to the,10
i'll have to,35
and even though,21
of the road,16
asian food in,27
if you're craving,25
string beans and,15
do you want,27
this place makes,12
were my favorite,15
to say we,20
i don't want,55
to like this,39
a go to,19
go to a,49
i saw that,16
the difference between,21
a small bowl,25
easy on the,13
as close as,15
complain about the,17
lettuce wraps are,15
sauce which was,17
won tons are,11
we took the,15
not only that,15
years and i,22
the veggie fried,12
you can't really,19
portions were big,13
around the area,12
something that is,12
have a few,26
believe this place,13
don't mind the,10
when the server,11
worth the drive,32
a bed of,47
the egg fu,10
meat and vegetables,10
think i have,20
i had just,12
all of which,20
to the manager,18
i sat down,22
like you are,17
surprised at the,20
be a good,43
eaten in the,14
chinese food like,12
stars from me,13
is always excellent,15
fried rice to,22
a little chewy,14
give you the,26
to my hotel,13
lot of take,13
haven't been back,14
i've ordered from,20
stick to the,25
i saw a,32
little pricey for,11
rice that came,18
and not very,36
food was not,74
even though there,16
hard time finding,14
the same as,58
it was great,81
down to a,10
my sweet and,15
friendly and quick,19
in a small,25
but what do,14
we were pretty,11
it is to,21
of people and,13
that i've been,30
have to do,19
place in my,14
some good food,10
to my stomach,10
loved this place,31
cashew chicken and,27
pieces of pork,11
other than the,34
delivery driver was,11
in under minutes,12
restaurant in the,116
the honey walnut,71
food in az,15
good prices and,17
look of the,10
is the bomb,14
the chow fun,65
chicken was delicious,11
in most chinese,11
eat here and,10
off the bone,16
of chow mein,16
maybe a little,19
some kind of,76
to the counter,27
the garlic shrimp,18
egg roll or,11
but the place,25
to die for,135
is great for,35
of pei wei,10
we ordered a,108
delivery from this,18
pretty good deal,12
to the casino,15
it's a great,48
and pretty much,13
heat to it,13
the size of,61
decent chinese food,87
place is really,41
pretty good food,22
there aren't many,14
i was too,15
best chinese in,63
shredded pork with,11
the wall with,12
we had just,15
favorite dish is,25
the yang chow,10
try something new,40
i've been looking,17
time i have,43
took so long,10
and they would,17
we called in,10
must try if,11
go here for,32
i have not,71
also tried the,41
they charge you,10
items that i,12
have been the,25
it was just,218
definitely had better,14
large portions and,21
but the service,111
able to get,40
very kind and,11
after the first,21
the price they,10
we received our,16
and i enjoyed,25
we walked in,80
for cheap chinese,15
customer service and,26
food was good,221
and the soup,28
that looked like,16
to find another,15
but it has,21
rice and lo,11

taste to it,35
under new management,17
i will try,39
come with soup,18
new favorite chinese,23
get to the,28
it was bland,22
prices are reasonable,83
spicy but not,19
it makes for,11
the only person,15
and well prepared,11
but the rest,11
is very tasty,28
for this dish,13
but not worth,10
bring it back,11
about the price,12
definitely recommend this,40
restaurant in madison,16

to try everything,10
this place was,270
to what i,21
on yelp and,29
it all off,10
extremely nice and,21

few years and,11
the time for,10
few pieces of,18

i really wish,10
something like this,11

a quick fix,11
the past few,22
fact that there,12
roll and crab,19

for the location,12
some of my,65
flavor and the,35
the decor of,20
from work and,16
beef stew noodle,11

looked like the,10
he didn't even,10
pepper pork chops,80
i have my,15
and tasty and,12
compared to the,50
i dont know,25
the best for,11
this area and,11
to start with,16
so fresh and,23
my list of,13
ever had in,40
been a fan,14
real chinese food,90
not so much,41
and what i,23
and what a,10
as if they,33
coming back to,30
place an order,27
this place to,117
but the beef,13
the street from,72
i don't usually,11
eaten here before,11
it was that,27
i ordered their,19
their food and,21
the other night,37
our food and,30
but not as,34
at first we,10
my co workers,38
than anything else,11
the flavors are,30
traditional chinese dishes,13
few years back,14

san gabriel valley,12
a couple times,39
always come back,11
fan of this,26
the staff and,19
a few friends,12
staying at the,56
and service was,60
i ordered shrimp,12
i thought was,39
that it is,90
really like their,13
they don't have,68
top of a,12
every chinese restaurant,15
did take out,17
minutes to come,11
it looked like,44
fried green beans,11
of going to,10
the fried chicken,22
can't say that,14
time we are,12
friendly as well,10
soup came out,10
everything we tried,14
walk in the,19
but when the,17
dine in experience,13
need to get,19
i'm so glad,18
when we went,27
the chicken chow,52
will order from,24
used to in,11
for an entree,11
stuff on the,14
on friday night,12
the lemon chicken,90
of crab puffs,21
for and the,11
on the side,185
me start off,11
because the service,25
what the heck,27
fact that it,21
what we ordered,40
then i would,10
never come back,12
the food or,15
clean and the,74
back to eat,10
take it home,17
bland and the,26
for what i,20
my first choice,12
on spring mountain,33
food to feed,11
let them know,27
and it didn't,16
order from them,52
ordered from this,14
here but i,10
at a decent,14
but i felt,15
menu on the,15
for the check,20
on what you,13
to try out,44
get the lunch,13
restaurant i've been,11
possibly the best,16
pass on the,10
take out from,99
and go to,27
they are super,16
that we were,53
type of restaurant,13
instead of rice,11
sad to see,13
for dinner as,11
prices are a,36
and chow fun,11
of a wait,13
the food always,11
like spicy food,13
thought the food,33
was very flavorful,29
would be good,16

thing i would,15
since we live,10
a few items,18
greasy and not,10
is to go,11

is the best,364
the servers are,53
the lo mein,153

and piping hot,12
for a large,20
on the inside,83

the most part,55
really enjoy the,19

more than once,15
here is delicious,14
the panda express,24
i don't recommend,13

better chinese restaurants,19
place that has,21
were just ok,19
tso's chicken was,28

a second time,13
small bowl of,21
place is definitely,25
a hard time,34
what they are,34
we each ordered,11

except for the,49
fried rice so,11
one of them,44
which was delicious,19
if you're a,37
at one of,25
bowl of egg,16
you don't have,54
the street to,17

authentic chinese restaurants,11
mediocre chinese food,23
when i come,26

with just the,28
after we ordered,23
with bbq pork,21
took care of,13
would say the,15
right and the,15
the family style,14
on the floor,25
should have been,56
food and we,15
worth the extra,11
is a nice,59
and the inside,13
average for a,12
us at the,15
the lunch specials,213
i could find,13
very spicy and,12
a large group,37
while it was,11
rolls were good,13
when i'm craving,10
enough to feed,24
i usually have,15
it had a,107
inside and the,11
the beef was,148
my first review,17
food is prepared,11
it was nice,42
place to get,65
off the menu,53
ended up paying,10
be a big,10
a lack of,13

sour soup was,111
a pleasant experience,10
there was just,16
to be seen,10

this restaurant are,11
up the food,29

based on my,20
many chinese restaurants,17
their lunch menu,25
and the lunch,26
am a big,16
to the front,16
reasonable and the,29
shrimp and beef,12
let me say,12

and so are,10
the bourbon chicken,13

when i need,17
to me that,18
as one of,16

its the best,24
to be found,25
to at least,13
become a regular,11

in my soup,13
when we ordered,19
i couldn't get,11
type of chinese,16
they put in,11
my kids love,11
i didn't see,25
something to be,23
a thumbs up,11
for a casual,11
best fried rice,23
and that's why,11
a nice touch,38
is hands down,12
the rice was,170
vegas for a,15
to get something,17
i hope you,15
pao shrimp and,11
but still very,11
at the bar,96
and i eat,20

to admit that,13
not much else,11
they brought it,14
a little dry,22
it but it,13
about minutes before,14
it's a very,18
sauce on top,12
to order off,16
very fresh and,44
it had been,69
with a small,14
to check this,13
since there are,11
chinese places in,42
in comparison to,18
to go with,73
it as a,21
the reason for,15
to check on,29
was like they,10
seems like the,13
see all the,11
i realize that,11
found my new,19
less than minutes,33
the real deal,42
place for me,10
place that serves,10
the price and,55

recommended by a,12
informed me that,14
what they were,25
and that they,13
just a bit,25
at this one,10

it was edible,15
dining room was,12
the moo shu,47
from one of,15
szechuan beef noodle,21

i'm not sure,147
such a small,12
eat at this,23
to take back,11
was going on,17
and then you,11
of chicken with,10
to go again,10
feels like a,12
probably come back,10
my friend was,13
have to give,30
the food out,17
food should be,10
for the price,307
to say this,31
the entire restaurant,18
as i could,12

is small but,10
i want to,112
to me as,12
we moved here,12
just the right,139
small portion of,11

i love love,10
and i'm sure,11
and to the,10

not that good,24
you off with,11
the food isn't,44
the young lady,14
it took a,35
chinese and i,13
the first place,47
that's exactly what,10
the happy hour,30
for some good,33
just right for,11

all the usual,12
and a half,65
to give me,28
not bad but,20
mood for some,20

you want something,21
here in las,10
chinese takeout place,14
for their food,10
i love my,13
now i know,16

the side of,29
a chinese food,71
the tasting menu,18
i've had the,40

pao chicken and,80
they are quick,17
worth every penny,18

all i could,11
for what it,61

it might be,30
that and the,10

we were a,27
the other half,14

we were both,24
but in the,30
good with the,11
and hot and,56
i ordered the,668
this week and,10
here if you,26

i figured i'd,10
not to like,11
the other end,15
give them a,89
on the west,33
my fiance and,14
take my order,22
too much for,23
and looking for,15
which i have,11

of the hot,20
i agree with,42
but i wanted,12
is also very,25
was also great,11
could have eaten,13
haven't been there,10
and lack of,11
hong kong noodles,10
chicken is great,15
from new york,29
a large family,10
and cheap chinese,10
are super nice,12
this is probably,40
moo shoo pork,13

it is amazing,11
flavor of the,59
they had to,23
beef with broccoli,80
them a try,39
has become a,13

hot and the,19
bad at all,43
they no longer,17

like to see,21
in a place,11
better than i,19

this did not,11
my least favorite,17
not much flavor,13
i'd come back,16
i like how,14
you would think,26
if we had,14
but i would,72
about the food,93
they must have,25
the only other,11

stopped in to,16
little too much,19
some of these,12
i have come,20
with the amount,10
sour chicken was,30
will be returning,22
shrimp in it,19
wrong with it,10
walked in to,17
can be a,64
fried won ton,15
nice and hot,16
based on the,99
no idea what,37
it was more,44
at home for,10
noodles were just,12
a meal that,12
and told us,12
chow fun is,24
here at least,41
but they don't,14
with rice and,33
food quality has,10
past few years,12
fast service and,23
the food arrived,45
anything you order,11
not be the,20
of the bellagio,17
is above average,14
had in phoenix,25
and the pork,60
and very reasonable,12
and very reasonably,12
food was excellent,47
in a timely,32
if you happen,10
but the fried,17
was really looking,10
out a little,12
in a good,35
for people who,20
is the owner,13
ordered orange chicken,25
not chinese food,11
i would say,100
be back to,70
and two entrees,10
that it's not,15
the looks of,13
to start off,16
but i never,18
and very flavorful,15
food i got,12
greasy and the,15
but there were,26
pan fried noodle,25
than panda express,51
the menu was,52
the few places,13
the chef was,15
thing is that,27
little strip mall,11
because they have,23
of pork and,18
be willing to,11
the area i,10
so glad i,23
flavor at all,25
some of them,13
chinese food ever,32
and i want,10
glad i found,12
for an appetizer,34
in the place,51
enough for the,15
that will be,11
looking for some,48
than any other,22
panda express in,20
is definitely the,22
the food from,24
at least it,18
in one of,20
attentive and helpful,12
and have tried,11
this has to,17
so i ordered,48
than this place,19
while i waited,29
came to our,16
kung pao chicken,500
and broccoli and,40
food is always,213
the soup dumplings,16
is the first,43
they were very,68
food is better,13
meal and the,11
won't be coming,24
for the soup,29
did not seem,17
and called it,10
want to make,11
the bar and,22
i think my,20
was a real,11
chicken was dry,23
this review is,43
that i could,38
sea bass was,13
the best chinese,587
and the spicy,29
that is not,43
after we were,13
always end up,12
both times i,16
ordered off the,10
was delicious and,71
on the corner,13
it's close to,27
need to know,15
the next day,179
to get here,21
chicken and sweet,18
and garlic chicken,17
a bit overpriced,16
with egg drop,26
we got it,14
if i have,19
even though i,52
from a chinese,33
with the owner,14
ny chinese food,13
me and i,27
the reviews on,29
seems to have,28
wanted to see,10
my chinese food,39
i would definitely,132
portion size is,17
it's really good,16
pretty good and,66
enough for a,18
pork chop was,11
lao ching hing,12
very disappointed in,15
have never experienced,12
was okay but,13
and a few,69
then we got,10
have a nice,28
have given them,11
offer brown rice,10
you wait for,10
in las vegas,233
was probably the,29
at mandalay bay,10
that it wasn't,25
the restaurant and,67
here for some,10
were a lot,22
glasses of water,15
with a bowl,16
was not that,32
is why i,27
just looking for,10
the best in,99
paper wrapped chicken,12
and i wouldn't,12
in a thick,11
have found a,13
and give you,11
better quality food,14
way too much,45
rolls and crab,14
soup was a,32
to satisfy my,14
i tried it,36
the moo goo,27
veggies in the,21
caught my eye,11
then you should,10
don't do it,11
crab rangoon was,18
food to come,16
about years now,16
and for the,46
not very friendly,10
is at the,11
but we are,11
and take out,26
and take our,10
style pan fried,11
would find in,15
spring rolls and,36
which was a,74
we order from,11
and the dish,16
usually when i,14
the roasted duck,18
want to come,22
that it's a,17
place a few,12
what i expected,40
pao chicken had,12
have a little,21
noodles and rice,12
me that i,20
in the middle,128
one get one,10
to try them,20
the perfect amount,32
i bit into,15
the menu is,220
ask for the,71
ordered a side,20
sign on the,25
as this place,10
but it seemed,12
i hope it,10
close to home,49
came out to,74
but i wish,10
but the sauce,43
and the garlic,15
find a chinese,15
went out of,13
that the place,21
had dinner here,18
in order to,35
it for us,10
they had it,16
good food but,10
i really don't,25
your typical chinese,40
and green onions,26
a fortune cookie,26
customer service was,32
dishes as well,10
to get good,10
a quick meal,21
singapore rice noodles,27
and orange chicken,93
the almond chicken,23
dishes that are,25
like this in,12
the best things,10
there is no,105
from the staff,12
for happy hour,29
that was it,11
but the rice,11
a bit disappointing,11
i do have,24
place as a,10
wasn't what i,12
with the pork,17
your order and,10
were pretty good,54
say the food,25
we had was,24
took us to,10
one piece of,15
to the one,10
in a light,29
out at a,12
you won't regret,15
and salt and,18
too spicy for,10
service was okay,19
much as you,11
so if you,108
add a little,10
fun to watch,15
i was glad,19
the front of,45
first thing i,25
you want chinese,11
ordered general tso's,13
to eat when,13
i can find,13
but i don't,84
not even close,22
and the tea,12
owner is a,12
i really did,10
i've only had,12
a month ago,12
went here with,35
the point of,21
too sweet and,18
tasty and i,11
in the kung,10
than i thought,10
skimp on the,17
food was cold,27
orange beef is,12
other fast food,14
a good idea,17
the best places,16
that their food,12
i was sitting,10
it to me,18
there are always,14
the right amount,129
placed our order,13
to top it,42
craving some good,12
but not for,14
don't let the,46
pork wonton in,13
long time for,12
this is how,14
wouldn't recommend this,15
the food they,18
order your food,14
soon as i,40
other then that,10
you get the,72
maybe next time,12
the dish is,19
fried rice had,22
fried rice has,14
chicken egg rolls,11
the price is,132
only complaint i,11
a little more,154
expect to be,17
everything has been,13
your taste buds,24
the light rail,25
good but i,39
i looked up,11
food i had,18
ever since i,20
it and i,33
i got was,26
was soft and,12
listed on the,18
seems a bit,10
with the hot,25
between two people,10
list of places,10
when i heard,10
they have really,19
it's hard to,67
can't go wrong,92
i know my,11
it wasn't too,25
of the dinner,10
the sauces are,23
the beef lo,22
kung pao is,11
to have dinner,13
i wish i,114
i haven't eaten,10
the vegetables were,38
for a nice,34
and i wasn't,24
matter of fact,12
in a spicy,21
with bits of,16
the wall that,15

and the woman,14
even get to,12
my meal was,18
price you pay,11
salt n pepper,16

the salted fish,16

to do is,10
to do it,26
and try some,19
and we have,38
we tried this,16
sit at the,29
probably one of,38
it was awesome,26
they were not,44
is coming from,10
salt pepper pork,38
was pretty standard,14
came with it,26
when i say,24
and a beef,10
shark fin soup,16
with my order,21
just what i,20
i would try,40
attention to detail,15
just how i,11
the best egg,27
have a craving,18
go with the,41
was not spicy,31
the people who,48
to let them,16
it would take,18
there were only,51
took a few,13
for a side,11
go wrong with,71
close to this,11
this place seems,11
this is another,12
a bad meal,56
of the entree,14
for the quality,58
the ones that,13
won ton noodle,19
this place sucks,17
and each time,33
but the quality,37
it was full,15
goo gai pan,58
lady on the,20
is pretty good,163
take out food,19
at any of,10
had to eat,15
give it another,32
table next to,29
salt and pepper,317
that i had,77
restaurant that serves,16
more than enough,60
of the meat,33

texture of the,27
of the meal,132
got an order,19
going to get,37

in the right,13
great deal for,15
and both times,29
minutes for a,13
if you see,13
picky when it,18
the broth was,90
the mistake of,16
to get you,18
to go on,19
for a better,10
that the service,25
i can't say,55
is by far,79
right next to,63
had better chinese,16

in a pan,11
eating at the,15
as i would,24
a little of,18
a little on,62
if i would,20
first time tonight,15
would be great,14
is the pork,12
it would be,227
definitely come here,14
a new restaurant,16
they have a,334
of the noodles,23
hit or miss,56
or twice a,11
for the service,31
it was crispy,13
love the shrimp,10
and broccoli is,12
be sure to,76
at the very,13
felt like a,10

and delicious food,18
for the past,37
i would ever,11
a great chinese,40

and quality of,28
not a huge,47
chinese cuisine in,13
a lunch special,72
she had the,10

for good chinese,65
i can say,109
but make sure,10
a few things,45

i especially love,11
couple of things,10
so this is,17
on the small,13
there is an,18
i usually order,46
when we asked,27

the wor won,15
and we both,26
you are staying,16
and raised in,11
for years and,85
you order your,10
and they gave,29

the credit card,17
rolls were not,10
and came with,14
me for the,14
you really can't,16
i ordered from,36

i guess that,17
sense of humor,12
the food there,20

a crab puff,28
go there for,23
that i've tried,16
great place to,105
and she had,10
order as well,10
very reasonably priced,38
which made it,19
the house fried,40
here because it,10
still on the,11
during my stay,10
at the front,59
since we were,40
if there was,34
have not been,52
place was very,22
sour chicken and,62
on the beef,10
the same shopping,14
a hong kong,14

other reviewers have,15
chicken egg foo,27
soup and the,69
you had to,15
just wish they,12
flavors of the,10
lo mien and,11

food is quite,10
chen wok is,11
the hot sour,58

think that the,13
the food was,1542
in the window,11
and enjoy the,14

the sushi bar,17
to this one,16
it ended up,16
a great price,64
it a little,18
for me to,106
my food was,55
thought it was,142
i started with,15
in mind that,19
i have nothing,11
for some authentic,10
when you're in,13
which was nice,42
the workers are,15
from time to,23
thought i was,19
to get chinese,23

they should have,15
sesame chicken was,46
get back to,25
they had no,10
sort of a,11
nice and spicy,15
but better than,10
love the food,65

meant to be,18
for a long,52
one of these,12
not good at,22

to give them,68
moo shu pork,63

not the most,26
we're in vegas,10
to each other,15
don't think i,43

sour sauce was,16
fried noodles with,34
dish and the,23
lunch and dinner,61

two orders of,10
new to the,25
we started out,10
more authentic chinese,12
almost like a,13
the best tasting,13
figure out how,17
it didn't taste,26
for what we,14
as chinese food,10
to closing time,10
everything was fresh,15
mu shu chicken,22
here with a,44
i've ever eaten,24
expect from a,29
the last two,25
pei wei and,12
on their menu,76
as i had,21
love the orange,13
and i thought,48
right off the,18
to love this,25
and told me,16
at the buffet,13
spicy and the,10
of my way,50
i had never,25
is not an,12
is not as,15
much of the,23
like orange chicken,17
all over the,55
chinese comfort food,14
wanted to take,10
is absolutely delicious,10
tomato and egg,10
thanks for the,13
book by its,13
is very reasonable,14
i will come,22
they brought the,11
were fresh and,37
ever go back,10

places to go,25
choice of rice,11
since moving to,26
the stir fry,29
a new york,10
late at night,26
i'm giving it,12
it's all about,20
don't forget to,16
specials are a,29
and thought it,15
chinese food since,21

best i've ever,85
is your place,29
and won ton,24
would try it,13

their house special,14
a touch of,11
to be and,14
tell you the,11
but as far,10
me was the,18
i just ordered,15
friendly and always,12
i pretty much,11
try more of,21
just say that,10
was a mistake,12
and not overly,12
the sauce was,249
very hard to,22
chow mien and,14
the ingredients are,21
a number of,59
was good enough,17
bf and i,36
probably my favorite,23
the point that,10
only chinese restaurant,25
i usually do,10
we've been to,21
authenticity of the,11
as any other,13
soup is very,19
the interior of,14
probably the only,10
with lobster sauce,65
try something else,34
favorite of the,10
judge a book,18
beef on a,14
years to come,11
know what it,23
a few other,42
quality is good,10
not feeling well,11
when i was,117

upon this place,15
if i didn't,15
time in a,12

i could have,106
we enjoyed the,12

i've come to,14
it when i,17
only to find,22
guy on the,16

dishes i have,12
been sitting there,10
recommend this place,189
with the dish,13
and fresh and,15
noodles with pork,10
and sesame chicken,29
because we are,11
the greasy side,15
most of all,14
a group of,118
the brown rice,28

how good the,23
for at least,45
here years ago,17
of the tables,24
least a dozen,10
chunks of chicken,18
noodle and the,13
not go back,40
chinese restaurants that,31
the taste of,61
sour soup had,12
said it would,27
fast food chinese,85
a million times,13
a small order,11
mein noodles were,15
for you and,11
hunan special chicken,12
enough food for,38
of us and,31
for about a,15
something a little,14
in our group,11
i opted for,29
not worth the,54
a long night,11
best chinese take,22
definitely a fan,10
instead of white,10
chow mein or,11
great value for,16
the soy sauce,27
not that great,26
more often than,10
wait for a,35
with the best,20
group of friends,27
seated in the,10
it wasn't very,18
so far from,10
was filled with,28
is a lot,39

to have lunch,23
after a few,34
on the way,69

of the little,11
at any chinese,12
how this place,17
was served on,14
and told them,12

after eating here,17
chicken in a,19
this isn't a,15
able to order,16
this place more,16
quality and taste,19
of the old,12

a high end,17
from any other,11
get a little,24

one of the,835
in caesar's palace,10
we ordered take,18
ended up here,21
loved it and,10
can say that,15
walk up to,10

i'll be going,10
love their egg,11
ordered hot and,12

huge fan of,63

the interior is,36
do not come,13
hit the spot,74
i know is,10
for a free,10
in on the,12
ones in the,10
nice and crispy,19
food we ordered,13
in my life,66
and full of,54
pork egg roll,11
but the broth,13
it took them,10
i didn't find,15
make it a,31
i've had a,24
my only complaint,57
as the food,39
is usually a,16
definitely be going,19
get the orange chicken,10
the general tsao's chicken,10
had a good flavor,14
here a few times,67
was pretty good but,14
and i can say,10
if i'm in the,11
i have had in,73
and the meat was,14
place is great for,14
was the fried rice,14
it is the best,40
night and it was,11
and the portions are,85
with salt and pepper,11
all of it was,23
seems to be the,13
good chinese restaurant in,12
the price and the,13
just the right amount,100
to try it again,12
based on the food,11
to the kitchen and,12
is a lot of,18
twice and both times,10
if you really want,10
was a nice touch,10
i was happy to,14
be in the area,11
if i had to,16
to say it was,16
and the rice was,21
and the honey walnut,11
in las vegas and,13
i will be going,20
i'm not sure why,17
great place to get,13
wanted to try it,18
i was craving some,17
this place is in,12
a group of us,11
to make it spicy,10
and the egg roll,16
my friend and i,51
food is pretty good,46
the better chinese restaurants,14
our favorite chinese restaurant,10
with white rice and,11
plenty of food for,13
the food has always,20
with one of the,13
if you are in,62
better than panda express,32
but i had to,20
i was a bit,35
a bit too much,16
a fan of this,11
but for some reason,12
i was excited to,27
when i'm in the,16
to go back to,29
what we wanted to,11
it used to be,31
to eat in the,10
to go back and,34
a chinese restaurant that,15
had a hankering for,10
the lady at the,16
the perfect amount of,29
for authentic chinese food,14
end of the meal,24
go to spot for,16
was going to be,31
i went in and,10
this place is one,16
it back to the,10
am a huge fan,10
diamond in the rough,14
salt and pepper shrimp,65
craving some chinese food,11
hong kong style chow,21
and the amount of,15
go to a chinese,13
and they are very,16
the chinese cultural center,40
to sit at the,13
service is always friendly,11
place all the time,12
but i think the,11
and sour sauce was,13
not worth the price,14
what i was looking,12
to come back to,18
are one of the,10
we started with the,36
the sauce on the,36
can you ask for,14
all of the other,10
go back to this,22
and it did not,12
our go to chinese,22
to give them another,13
to have a good,10
asked if i was,11
i have been to,86
that i didn't like,12
the orange chicken and,91
for about years now,15
i ate here for,10
the best i have,69
the employees are friendly,12
and you can tell,13
orange chicken and the,36
this place does not,11
go to panda express,25
across the street and,12
this place for dinner,12
it was still good,15
order take out from,12
last time i went,14
here for lunch with,11
to try this place,101
and one of my,10
would come back again,10
i've been going here,20
looked and tasted like,11
keep that in mind,11
food is delicious and,25
been here several times,24
the food was fresh,28
the won tons were,10
but i don't think,26
if you don't have,11
i ordered the sesame,19
we were ready to,17
food for the price,31
not good at all,22
since i was in,14
to spice it up,10
of the fried rice,17
like a lot of,21
is supposed to be,22
bang for the buck,10
the prices are fair,14
you are on a,11
next time i'm in,26
special and it was,10
service was top notch,12
was not going to,11
times i have been,20

time i go to,11
when i first moved,13
was a great experience,10

nice and the food,13
i can honestly say,16
and it was just,20
this is a must,13
definitely the best chinese,10
chicken lunch special and,13
of the worst chinese,15
it was better than,18
you are staying at,11
of food for your,13
they give you the,11
would eat here again,10
place for chinese food,34
it was very good,60
while staying at the,10
is that you can,11
not a bad place,12
i have to give,15
a sit down meal,10
the xiao long bao,17
on the west side,27

in a good way,23
thought this place was,11
of the best i,19
the place is not,10

the food is always,152
been a long time,11
chinese food and i,16
i decided to try,67
we got our food,13
i have no idea,46
i'm not sure how,17
the fact that you,14
gave it a try,10
clean and the food,11
if you have to,15
and the beef was,29
had a chance to,12
for a restaurant that,12
for over years and,12
makes up for it,19
when i am in,15
came with egg drop,10
after a long night,10
and the wontons were,10
great place for a,10
is good and the,23
i can see why,14
was not very good,17
the service was very,52
you are in the,47
this place is the,74
food was pretty good,64
little bit of everything,13
prices are reasonable and,23
went here for dinner,15
and not too salty,10
didn't know what to,12
a few weeks ago,32
the service is friendly,25
the food was bland,18
will go back again,11
is the best i've,27
my wife had the,23
expect it to be,11
i had the beef,27
we didn't have to,13
was only one other,11
the lettuce wraps and,11
to ask for it,12
and the sesame chicken,18
that i am not,12
not bad at all,26
a good variety of,12
is a very good,13
soup was the best,10
many other chinese restaurants,11
the fact that the,32
i went to pick,10
on the other side,17
the lunch menu is,22
i've been here twice,16
i don't know why,39
goo gai pan and,11
in the heart of,11
and said it was,19
day of the week,12
a chinese restaurant and,11
the restaurant is a,14
was my first visit,11
the szechuan beef noodle,16
on the side and,19
and i don't know,10
that we had to,11
other restaurants in the,15
much to look at,15
the lemon chicken and,20
food was great and,23
pork fried rice is,20
so it was a,20
tried the kung pao,10
i like this place,43
food in las vegas,26
went to pick up,12
for lunch and dinner,22
and pepper pork chop,13
ready for pick up,11
any other chinese restaurant,16
i went with a,18
egg roll and a,21
here for the first,23
but other than that,31
all you can eat,63
the three of us,10
order from them again,31
you can ask for,11
were a bit on,14
the portions are generous,16
new york style chinese,35
view of the fountains,13
my hot and sour,11
could use a little,12
be my go to,12
because the food was,20
but the chicken was,10
honey walnut shrimp is,11
the food here and,11
the new york new,10
and i don't think,12
and i would have,13
which is a great,10
and your choice of,13
our server was very,13
told me it would,10
had to wait for,23
was delicious and the,19
and a side of,22
the mongolian beef and,69
for the most part,54
sour soup which was,11
fried rice is pretty,10
so you can see,11
it was like a,15
and sour soup was,83
i really liked the,29
there was only one,31
good amount of food,14
the beef and broccoli,58
to pick up my,14
the lo mein and,13
you can choose from,11
supposed to be a,12
to try more of,16
chicken and sweet and,14
i think this is,22
of the mill chinese,14
they don't skimp on,10
good chinese food for,17
house of hong kong,23
but it is very,10
but the food makes,11
we were looking for,35
my go to for,11
was all white meat,10
have been a little,11
the last time we,21
and i had the,29
it reminds me of,14
was our first time,17
and won ton soup,15
stay away from the,30
not a good sign,14
been able to find,18
i had to pay,12
one star because the,10
we will not be,22
i think it was,33
so i can't speak,11
the prices are good,24
you are in vegas,13
your typical chinese restaurant,15
a great chinese restaurant,23
to this place for,27
is the same as,12
szechuan beef noodle soup,19
this was our first,18
in the wall chinese,51
in black bean sauce,52
the sesame chicken and,18
it did not taste,11
some of the food,15
best i've had in,32
restaurant in the area,21
not a fan of,95
not a lot of,38
the beef was very,15
i would love to,12

i did not want,10
it ended up being,12
and all of the,12
food is always great,15
out of this world,48
better than most places,10
sweet and sour sauce,162
i won't go back,12
the same as the,15
you don't have to,33
chinese restaurants in vegas,12
this place at least,11
on a side note,10
chinese restaurants in town,15
from the bay area,10

we asked for the,12
the worst i have,17
wor won ton soup,40
every time i go,36
what you would expect,21
shrimp fried rice was,15
chicken was dry and,13
the bbq pork fried,19
don't be fooled by,13
i've never had anything,13
i've found in the,11
and i have been,57
my favorite chinese food,30
place was very clean,12
but i've had better,12
everything on the menu,45
not what i would,11
food was cold and,11
say this is the,14
it also came with,15
here a couple times,10
the wonton soup is,18
out of your way,12
the best fried rice,20
for it to be,16
i also love the,10
to chinese take out,10
is a chinese restaurant,19
to try it out,41
going to this place,15
can't wait to come,16
was very tender and,11
is that if you,11
get a ton of,12
i was looking forward,11
a new chinese restaurant,11
place is always clean,11
the best chinese i've,33
i love the food,20
when i go to,11
it was a little,76
but not as good,14
food and the service,20
the crispy duck salad,10
to try a few,11
have never had a,46
in the wall restaurant,11
am a big fan,12
the menu is very,12
the service has always,14
as spicy as i,12
yourself a favor and,31
the service was excellent,36
after reading all the,15
if you like chinese,21
but as far as,10
be back for more,14
i wasn't sure if,13
of the place is,16
order from here again,51
is a must try,15
food was hot and,23
place reminds me of,11
lived in china for,10
is the place for,32

and the fact that,22
was friendly and attentive,14
lunch special is a,12
i have ever eaten,27
chow mein and the,17
are a couple of,11
for the first time,150
the rice was not,11
places i've been to,13
of the fact that,14
the seafood hot pot,10
my way home from,16
i won't be going,14
is second to none,10
the beef was a,14
it is one of,20
if you have a,54
a couple of times,68
with some of the,19
live in the area,19
me and my wife,12
this place a star,10
and kung pao chicken,38
and sour chicken was,21
for a long time,41
a glass of water,12
i came here for,25

here at least once,22
over the menu and,10
the fried wontons were,10
we also had the,59
good and the prices,14
to kick it up,10
to try something new,26
it's the best chinese,24
wouldn't recommend this place,13
it was a bit,54
so close to my,11
it hit the spot,10
and tasted like it,10
i wish it was,13
the prices are very,57
chinese food and this,19
the first place i,13
after reading some of,11
the all you can,12
is a great place,43
and decided to try,37
i would have expected,11
their hot sour soup,13
was just as good,10
soup i have ever,15
a lot of other,22
a side of rice,21
this place is that,28
taste of the food,27
best chinese i've had,26
this will be my,12
i had the egg,10
bowl of egg drop,14
the hand pulled noodles,27
mood for chinese food,14
right amount of spice,23
the amount of food,73
my favorite dish is,18
as far as i,13
nothing to complain about,11
egg rolls and the,10
ended up ordering the,11

the lettuce wraps were,10
for a chinese restaurant,55
that they have a,12
beef noodle soup and,23

the pot stickers were,35

a good chinese food,15
this place was a,19
had a great time,14
come back to try,24
that the place is,11
the fried rice is,51

and very reasonably priced,12
egg rolls and crab,13
at first i thought,10
quality of food and,11
at the top of,18
a lot of money,11
name of the restaurant,11
kung pao chicken and,78
could have used a,13
some of the best,173

i would say that,17
the food is consistent,12
husband and i were,18
beef noodle soup is,22
and fried rice were,11
of hot and sour,21
if you don't eat,10

i found this place,40
ordering from them again,12

this place at all,14

where the food is,11
i would have been,18
i must say i,15
going back to the,10

good chinese food and,19
was by far the,15
to come back here,14
that it was a,19
this would be a,22
like i was in,16

figure out how to,11
and i ordered the,28

with the hot and,10
like the orange chicken,12

but i think they,11
i love this place,204
the hot and sour,259
the service here is,20

to find a decent,14
a large portion of,11
my husband ordered the,20
clean and the service,13
a nice place to,17

on the menu that,28
this place is like,11
beef with broccoli and,15
shrimp in lobster sauce,43
it's a small place,11
and there was a,33
looking for a place,19
one of those places,32
the west side of,12

it was supposed to,16
hot and sour and,10
chinese take out place,30

i wanted to go,13
moved to the area,10
my favorite was the,18
to be on the,10
from this place again,12
and i think they,10
i also had the,19
i won't be coming,13
but the prices are,11
a fan of the,50
rice and orange chicken,15
the price is reasonable,16
as it gets in,13
it is a bit,27
is a little more,12
agree with the other,11
the sauce was just,13
i had the sesame,11
the food was horrible,10
have to say that,43
of the restaurant is,21
my order was ready,12
a good place for,17
the chinese new year,10
they will make it,11
it was good and,15
front of the house,12
times and the food,17

and will be back,13
with the food and,14

looking for a quick,12
little on the bland,10
to take home for,10
very friendly and the,20
i would come back,43
had a problem with,13
the rest of the,158
and the portion was,18
on my list of,11
took the time to,10
it is close to,14
i will never order,15
every time i visit,10
to say i was,12
with a bunch of,13

here since i was,13
the next time i,27
i got the chicken,12

quite a bit of,22
i usually get the,33
the decor is a,10
house special chow mein,13
for half the price,17
the soup of the,11
good and the food,18
at least a dozen,10
food at a great,23
there were so many,11
a lot of chinese,34
their food is pretty,10
thought i would try,10
been eating here for,30
the portion size was,20
at all and the,11
but the fried rice,13
we have eaten here,15
and chicken fried rice,32
i love coming here,10
the house chicken is,14
and it was really,23
year and a half,12
the guy on the,12
come to this place,13
eating here for years,13
give them another try,13
and the orange chicken,35
favorite chinese place in,16
the prices are cheap,12
is definitely one of,10
but the flavor was,15
is a great chinese,10
on the table and,20
the portions are large,36
which was very tasty,10
this place is a,109
when it comes to,128
what more do you,10
is pretty good and,21
a little pricey but,11
fried rice is also,10
i think i will,15
for the main course,13
food was good but,19
was piping hot and,11
of a language barrier,10
of the better chinese,27
their fried rice is,17
to see if i,13
some of the worst,18
my favorite part of,14
of the meal was,25
used to go to,19
i had the shrimp,18
got the orange chicken,32
food was so bad,11
good place to get,11
by far my favorite,17
this is a very,21
a good chinese place,25
was very good as,10
i asked them to,16
the chicken fried rice,61
and cooked to perfection,12
fried rice and chow,22
over the past years,10
the restaurant was very,13
the gang pang chicken,10
i was not impressed,29
that there is a,13
the cream cheese wontons,15
the las vegas strip,11
too much of a,11
i cannot wait to,10
for the two of,13
have to say this,16
to find a new,11
the combination fried rice,13

for a place that,16
and the shrimp was,12
but all in all,12
the lan zhou beef,12

it is in the,16
i ended up ordering,14
it was hard to,12

least once a week,46
the service and the,13
i placed my order,22
but the orange chicken,13
to place for chinese,29
is excellent and the,14
definitely worth checking out,10

i had to ask,23
first thing i noticed,11
in front of us,25
the chicken was good,10
at most chinese restaurants,10
enough for me to,19
and they gave me,11
you can't beat the,20
thought it would be,25

this place is an,10
the best i've ever,81

for the price i,15
on top of a,12

of the best in,14
i got the mongolian,12

you can't go wrong,52
the middle of the,63
as long as i,10
it was our first,18
when you go to,12
i was a little,70
last time i ordered,12

place is a little,17
a little bit more,19
i love that they,17
i was starving and,15
just down the street,14
but in my opinion,10
would be a good,18
the shrimp with lobster,27
how i like it,10
is clean and the,16
to top it off,34
to try something else,11
it was more like,15
sour soup and the,16
in the back and,12
give this place a,116
to get chinese food,18
that it is a,12
look forward to trying,15
but it was good,22
the decor is very,12
when we went in,10
for a reasonable price,10

the star of the,16

place because of the,12
when the bill came,11
made me want to,14
the menu that i,11
have been eating here,23
i used to go,28
on top of it,13
if you find yourself,10
like the fact that,22
melts in your mouth,12
to go to a,11
the fried rice tasted,10
was good but i,16
chinese food restaurant in,16

in the wall that,11
if it weren't for,11
the owner is a,12
from out of town,26

the food was the,12
if you're going to,15
the food was all,11
of a chinese restaurant,11
an order of egg,13
and to be honest,10
to say that this,14
if you want a,37
the lo mein is,13
i must say that,21
is just as good,12
good but a little,12
the pot stickers and,15
then this place is,10
stay away from this,12
to see that they,10
this is a small,10

i have ever tried,10
i will say this,12
this place to anyone,34
they were going to,13
best chinese food i've,72
is more than enough,14
that it would be,23
told me that they,12
as far as chinese,12
the baked pork chop,10
of the other reviews,11
when i got it,18
was my first time,38
the worst i've ever,18
little hole in the,39
the wonton soup and,19

has the best chinese,16
had the orange chicken,52
prices are a bit,15
here is pretty good,11
with the quality of,16
it had a good,12
is always good and,16
the portion sizes are,25
this place should be,10
which i think is,13
and the server was,12
house special chicken and,10
decided to check it,12
some of my favorites,15
i went there for,11
shrimp with lobster sauce,64
restaurants in the valley,18
general tso's chicken is,13
i always get the,45
as soon as you,19
introduced me to this,11
all of the dishes,18
this was not the,11
i won't be ordering,10
was a bit bland,19
for a few years,21
it was very flavorful,10
asked if i wanted,14
something to be desired,17
right across the street,20
ordered from this place,10
food was good and,33
and the bbq pork,11
and i have to,39
it was filled with,12
china magic noodle house,23
find good chinese food,22
it's supposed to be,18
of their way to,12
service is excellent and,15
but the noodles were,13
and it was amazing,15
i had to spit,11
i went for the,15
the orange chicken was,114
love love this place,17
and some of the,22
the fact that they,53
soup is very good,12
one of our favorite,19
sweet and sour soup,21
were some of the,13
for some reason i,12
must try if you,10
best chinese in town,12
it could have been,21
mein and fried rice,17
close to my house,32
so i had to,40
to sit down and,12
but it is a,15
my boyfriend got the,14
if you are craving,17
and ordered take out,10
i've ever had in,19
came here with my,13
to be the best,22
my favorite is the,59
and so was the,21
eggplant in garlic sauce,16
due to the fact,16
i told him i,14
family has been going,10
the staff was very,48
was a little dry,16
and hot and sour,40
if you ask me,17
the fact that we,18
were able to get,10
of won ton soup,10
order of egg rolls,13
has just the right,10
the wall chinese food,12
me it would be,12
it was in the,12
was very clean and,19
the best chinese i,10
rice and an egg,18
the menu is huge,18
reminds me of the,19
the food is great,118
the first time today,18
we will never go,10
and a spring roll,20
they are always very,11
with the rest of,17
it is worth the,10
anything on the menu,10
to write a review,24
the chicken in the,12
picky when it comes,18
i give it a,11
had in a while,12
for quite some time,14
mom and pop chinese,11
service was a little,27
know what i mean,18
for a take out,17
times and each time,14

side of white rice,10
is always hot and,20
in an order and,10

only reason why i,11
only complaint is that,24

and pick it up,17
within a mile radius,11
if you are looking,104
i knew i was,12
and the service is,132
to get your food,12
so i'm not sure,10
for the past years,13
but it is good,15
and don't want to,16
place is small and,10
service was a bit,14
amount of food you,30
for a lot of,11
i have had a,19
but if you want,25
